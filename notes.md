# learning Javascript
## variables
You start by declaring a variable with the **let** keyword, followed by the name of the variable: 
```javascript
let myVariable = "Bob";
```

## Events
These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. Example handling the **click event**, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.
